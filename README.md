# Telegram_Bot
## Overview:
A Telegram Bot is a program that behaves like a regular chat partner with additional functions. It performs predefined tasks independently and without the user's involvement. The term bot is derived from the term for the robot. We can configure a bot for different purposes. e.g., Relevant machine data such as temperature or pressure information can be sent regularly via Telegram Bot to the department managers' tablets, smartphones, or PC workstations. This way, a complete overview of machine production is possible for this user group at any time.

The project is based on a Cloud architecture where I tried to create a basic Telegram Bot with essential functions. In the future, we can add more functionalities to this bot to get sensor data from sensors through serverless computing in real-time and store it in a NoSQL database to be easily accessible.

In the current position, the bot can suggest you exercise or work out according to the weather outside. Currently, we have to select a weather condition manually, but later we can also connect the bot to the actual sensors through serverless computing / AWS to get data from sensors & make decisions according to sensor data.
