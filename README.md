# Telegram_Bot
## Overview:
A Telegram Bot is a programme that behaves like a normal chat partner with additional functions. It performs predefined tasks independently and without the userâ€™s involvement. The term bot is derived from the term for robot. We can configure a bot for different purposes. e.g Relevant machine data such as temperature or pressure information can be sent regularly via Telegram Bot to the tablets, smartphones or PC workstations of the department managers. In this way, a complete overview of machine production is possible for this user group at any time.

The project is based on an Cloud architecture where I tried to create a basic Telegram Bot with basic functions. In future we can add more functionalities to this bot to get sensor data from sensors through serverless computing in realtime and stored in a NoSQL database to be easily accessible.

In the current position the bot is able to suggest you exercise or workout according to the weather outside. Currently we have to select a weather condition manually but later we can also connect the bot to the real sensors through serverless computing / AWS to get data from sensors & make decisions according to sensor data.
